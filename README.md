# Your-Face
A simple script to determine the importance of your face.

It echos the boolean value of `var_dump($face == $importance)`. Don't complain to me about the results, please.

## Instructions
The easiest way to preview this script is to copy the contents of index.php paste it into a php code runner. Or, you can install wamp/xamp and run the index file directly in your browser.
